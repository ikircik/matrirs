This repository consists of information about matrix, and reference implementation for rust.

I want this repository to be as useful and instructive as outstanding resources. I look forward to community support, especially in translations, detailing of lectures, increasing of examples, fixing typos, etc.

/docs: lectures
/ref_impl: reference implementation
